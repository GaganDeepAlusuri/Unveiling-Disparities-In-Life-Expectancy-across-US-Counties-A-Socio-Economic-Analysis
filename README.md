# Causes of Disparities in Life Expectancy Among Counties in USA

## Executive Summary
- Investigates life expectancy disparities in the US.
- Analyzes socio-economic, health factors, and environmental impact.

## Problem Definition and Significance
- Highlights the widening life expectancy gap across counties.
- Targets public health officials, researchers, and policymakers.

## Prior Literature
- Reviews studies on socio-economic status, healthcare access, and environmental factors.
- Discusses various models and predictors used in life expectancy studies.

## Data Source and Preparation
- Data from various national databases for all US counties (2019-2023).
- Variables: demographics, health behaviors, environment, healthcare access, social determinants.

## Predictor Table
- Details predictors like income, pollution, healthcare availability, and their estimated effects on life expectancy.

## Data Visualizations and Descriptive Analysis
- Presents visualizations showing correlations between predictors and life expectancy.

## Modeling
- Linear and LMER models to analyze data.
- Model selection based on robustness and relevance.

## Key Findings
- Household income, air pollution, and health behaviors significantly impact life expectancy.
- Unexpectedly, excessive alcohol consumption positively correlated with higher life expectancy.

## Recommendations
- Focus on improving income levels, reducing pollution, and promoting healthy behaviors.
- Emphasize public health policies and interventions.
